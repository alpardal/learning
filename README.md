See learning.md

Do whatever you want with this repo and the information in it.

Pull requests to help organize, format, and curate it very welcome.

### TODO

* Annotate the importance of the order of the resource and why
* Try to keep the list more focused on the useful and up-to-date than comprehensive
* Try to make the list easy to use to find whatnot
* How much non-ruby stuff should be in here? How?

### HISTORY

The list began as essentially a link dump, and then I added some other resources I had collected, while at it.

Some folks on the Ruby Rogues Parley list suggested I put it online so it could be forked and modified.
